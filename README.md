# Autonomous data collection for the neutron spin echo response function
Exploration of active learning applied to the neutron spin echo function.

## Files:
- Run Campaign General.ipynb: Notebook used to run experiment campaigns. Contains a complete description of the data files and their contents.
- FINAL DATA MAY: folder containing all of the data files
- Making Data Frames for gain factor.ipynb: Notebook for reducing speed gains to XLS sheets
